I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

      "\n",
      "Kalam also shares a personal anecdote from a little girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. He assured her that it was a thoughtful question and reassured her that the country was working towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the questioner's inquiry and assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, indicating that they would work on making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech focuses on empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness in India. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker highlights the desire of the youth to live in a developed India and the aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recalls a visit to Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions, but notes the need for providing physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also discusses an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which involves providing urban amenities in rural areas through the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity, and has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a successful initiative called Periyar PURA (Provision for Urban and Rural Areas) that aims to promote sustainable economic development in rural areas. Key highlights include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 200 acres of waste land have been transformed into cultivable land, enabling villagers to engage in various activities such as Jatropha cultivation, herbal and medicinal plant production, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Technological support from Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women and experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) helped villagers develop 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products.\n",
      "\n",
      "- This co-operative venture has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The speaker believes that 7000 such PURA initiatives are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions \"Seed to Food\" as a backbone for agricultural growth, but the details are not provided in the given text.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker had the opportunity to meet over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in various gardens, including Mughal Gardens and Bio-diesel gardens, and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving economic conditions through the principle of \"Seed to Food.\" The speaker expresses confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. On a separate occasion, the speaker met a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was smiling and had a positive attitude. He thanked those who had given him confidence and training. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he requested to sing in front of him. The speaker is inspired by this person's resilience and positive attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two main points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overcoming physical challenges through talent and perseverance**: The speaker shares a touching experience where a physically challenged person, encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others, showcases his latent talent in music. Despite the challenges, he blossomed and now wants to share his art to inspire others. This is evident from his performance in the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in July 2007, where he demonstrated his musical merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Overcoming the impact of disasters through partnership**: The speaker recounts his visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe loss, the villagers showed remarkable courage and resilience in facing their problems. They had praise for the Army, Air Force, and the state government for their rescue and relief efforts. The villagers' determination to overcome their challenges, rather than letting them overpower them, is a testament to their indomitable spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of courage in the face of calamities. The speaker shares two personal experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. During a relief operation after an earthquake, they witnessed the bravery of the children and villagers who participated in the operation, even though they had been affected by the disaster. The speaker also saw the participation of the acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and State Government authorities in providing relief grants to affected families.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In 2005, the speaker visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami. They were inspired by the tribal islanders who took in the affected victims as their own children, showing remarkable courage and compassion. The speaker was so moved that they composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to reflect on this experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the theme of connectivity for societal transformation, but the provided snippet does not fully elaborate on this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about a project proposal for the \"Pan African e-Network\" at an African Union meeting. \n",
      "\n",
      "The key points of the proposal are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A $100 million project to create a seamless network connecting 53 African countries.\n",
      "- Partnering with 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa) and 17 hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa) to create tele-education and tele-medicine centers across Africa.\n",
      "- Already commissioned a pilot project in Ethiopia for tele-education and tele-medicine.\n",
      "- An example is given of the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from the Prime Minister of India, although the name is not mentioned. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two key initiatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tele-consultation with African countries**: The Prime Minister mentions a program initiated in 2006, where India provides one-hour live tele-consultations to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, in cardiology and radiology. This is made possible through a Pan-African network, which will connect all 53 African countries for instant communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation and youth movement**: The Prime Minister expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, highlighting their bravery, commitment, and dedication to duty. He also mentions interacting with members of the para-military forces and police personnel who contribute to the safety and security of Indian citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the Prime Minister mentions a youth movement called \"Lead India 2020\" that aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is highlighting the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention a program called Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh. The speaker shares a personal experience of how the program has positively impacted the students, particularly in the Medak district, by instilling self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also shares a heartwarming story of a student leader who successfully changed her father's behavior by adopting the \"10-point oath\" from the training program. This anecdote gives the speaker confidence that the country's youth are on the right path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by emphasizing the power of India's youth, who make up 540 million people under the age of 25, and the need to empower them through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization while also pursuing economic growth. The speaker highlights the country's progress in the last sixty years, its natural resources, and the dedication of its 540 million youth. They express confidence in India's potential to become a developed nation by 2020 and attribute this optimism to the country's citizens, who are eager to contribute to the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then outlines a vision for a developed India 2020 with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution and access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. A harmonious balance between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Education with a value system available to all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. A destination for the world's most talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech ends with a message of hope and determination, quoting a famous poem that suggests that anything one desires can come true with hard work and determination. The speaker encourages the nation to strive towards achieving this vision and working together to create a better future for all Indians.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summary of the speech about the desired nation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker envisions a nation with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Access to high-quality healthcare for all citizens\n",
      "- Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance\n",
      "- Eradication of poverty and illiteracy\n",
      "- Zero crimes against women and children\n",
      "- A society where everyone feels included and valued\n",
      "- A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, possibly his final speech during his last five years in office. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Dr. Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support.\n",

He emphasized the need for a collective effort to achieve this goal, with every individual contributing their skills and talents to create a brighter future for the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam's experience with the Lead India 2020 Foundation, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, where thousands of students were trained in partnership with the District Administration, left him inspired by the transformation that took place among the students. He cited the example of Ms. Padma, a student leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda, who weaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10-point oath from the Lead India Training Camp. This gave him an assurance that the youth of India were on the right path through this mission-oriented program.\n",

      "With the ignited minds of the 540 million youth below the age of 25, Kalam recognized them as the most powerful resource on the earth, under the earth, and above the earth. He emphasized the need to empower the youth through value-based education and leadership, and to unlock their potential to create a brighter future for India.\n",

      "In conclusion, Kalam's five-year tenure as the President of India was marked by his commitment to accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth, empowering villages, and combating calamities with courage. His experiences reinforced his commitment to empowering individuals, fostering partnerships, and driving positive change in the country. His legacy continues to inspire future generations to work towards a Developed India by 2020, with a focus on accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth, empowering villages, and combating calamities with courage.\n",
